# OOSE2015: Carl, Malte & Rasmus
A game project.
The basic idea for the game has yet to be found. We know it has to be an arcade style game, possibly inspired by Super Smash T.V --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AapB7dW3HA
We are going to use free sprites which can be among other places found here:

The game is using the Slick2D game engine for java.
